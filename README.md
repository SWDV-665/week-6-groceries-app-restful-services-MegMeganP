Update---The bug is fixed on in groceries3.  The line 13 wasn't updated from weeks 4/5 to just "item" for week 6.  I have already installed Ionic v6 on my machine for the final project, but I will reinstall the v3 again to test this for sure.  The api still works, as it did before.

Old:
The database endpoints work great-I was able to get the GET to retrieve an individual item by ID.
The original video has the working demo of the database/HTTP methods
I attempted the app for many hours.  The "groceries" app seems to have had a bug somewhere that I cannot find.
The "groceries3' is after many, many hours of troubleshooting, and starting over but I still can't get it working.
The errors are different, and may be due to it not liking the browser, and wanting a device or emulator.
I am not sure what is going on and how I could go from a working app last week to this.  I will keep looking at it.
